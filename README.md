# advent-of-code
My solutions to http://adventofcode.com/, a coding puzzle for every day of advent

## Setup

Each year I pick a new language to try the challenges, except for the last three
years when I've used python.

2015 - R
2016 - Python
2017 - Python
2018 - Jupyter notebooks (in Python)

I use pyenv and virtul environments.
