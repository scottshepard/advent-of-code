# --- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---
#
# Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a 
# thank you card. 
# However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".
#
# You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".
#
# So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out 
# which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you 
# the gift. You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue 
# got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just what you wanted. 
# Or needed, as the case may be.
#
# The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few
# specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of 
# those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the 
# MFCSAM can detect:
#
# children, by human DNA age analysis.
# cats. It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.
# Several seemingly random dogs: samoyeds, pomeranians, akitas, and vizslas.
# goldfish. No other kinds of fish.
# trees, all in one group.
# cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.
# perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.
# In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping from
# the gift into the MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then 
# prints out a message on ticker tape:
#
# children: 3
# cats: 7
# samoyeds: 2
# pomeranians: 3
# akitas: 0
# vizslas: 0
# goldfish: 5
# trees: 3
# cars: 2
# perfumes: 1
#
# You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue. Things 
# missing from your list aren't zero - you simply don't remember the value.
#
# What is the number of the Sue that got you the gift?
#
# --- Part Two ---
#
# As you're about to send the thank you note, something in the MFCSAM's 
# instructions catches your eye. Apparently, it has an outdated 
# retroencabulator, and so the output from the machine isn't exact values - 
# some of them indicate ranges.
#
# In particular, the cats and trees readings indicates that there are greater 
# than that many (due to the unpredictable nuclear decay of cat dander and tree
# pollen), while the pomeranians and goldfish readings indicate that there are 
# fewer than that many (due to the modial interaction of magnetoreluctance).
#
# What is the number of the real Aunt Sue?
